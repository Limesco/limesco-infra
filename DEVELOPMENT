This is the liminfra distribution, Limesco's production software. Read the
INSTALL file for installation instructions. This file explains how development
of liminfra is done.

This distribution is divided in four directories:
* tools, which contains all tools and applications
* daemons, which contains long-running daemons (currently empty)
* lib, which contains the code shared between all tools and daemons
* t, tests for the code in the lib directory (currently empty)

The naming convention of tools depends on the object they work on; if there is
one, the tool is called ${object}-${action}, e.g. account-modify (also for
account creation). If there is none, it is simply called like its action, e.g.
upgrade.

Every tool consists of a Perl file (.pl), which is built up from a set of
functions and a "caller-block":

	if(caller) {
		...runner code...
	}
	sub function {
		...function code...
	}

The code inside the caller block is run when the .pl file is directly
executed. The code can use the functions in the rest of the file. It can
also use the library functions if it includes them beforehand as follows:

	use lib 'lib';
	use lib '../lib';
	use lib '../../lib';
	use Limesco;

When run without arguments, tools are expected to either do a simple job or
explain how to correctly call them. If they are called with --help as one of
the arguments, they should explain how they are used. If they have dangerous
side effects, they should ask whether it is OK to continue in the caller block.

All tools are accompanied by a test file (.t), which sources the .pl file and
therefore does not run the caller-block. This allows it to test all functions.
They can use Test::PostgreSQL and Limesco->new_for_test($pgsql->dsn) to create
a Limesco object to use for the tools' functions. See the existing tests, for
example those of the upgrade tool, for examples.
