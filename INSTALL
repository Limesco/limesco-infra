To generate a Makefile, run:

	$ perl Makefile.PL

This will also warn you of any missing modules, so make sure to read the
output.

Then, to run the tests:

	$ make
	$ make test

If the tests were succesful, install:

	$ sudo make install

This distribution requires at least PostgreSQL version 9.3; it uses the
btree_gist module from the postgres-contrib repository. To give your normal
development UNIX user access to the server switch to the UNIX user running
PostgreSQL and run (substituting $USERNAME with your username):

	$ createuser -d $USERNAME

Then, as $USERNAME, you can use createdb and dropdb to create and destroy a
liminfra database as you see fit. To open a Postgres shell to the empty
liminfra database, use 'psql liminfra'. To tell the code distribution how to
access the database, copy the limesco.conf.sample file to /etc/limesco.conf and
modify it if needed. Then, run the upgrade tool:

	$ upgrade.pl

This will initialize your database so you can get started. Read the DEVELOPMENT
file for more information on developing liminfra.
