To generate a Makefile, run:

	$ perl Makefile.PL

This will also warn you of any missing modules, so make sure to read the
output.

Then, to run the tests:

	$ make
	$ make test

If the tests were succesful, install:

	$ sudo make install

This distribution uses PostgreSQL; to create a user and database, switch to
the UNIX user running PostgreSQL and run (substituting $USERNAME with the
user you're going to use for development or production):

	$ createuser $USERNAME
	$ createdb -O $USERNAME liminfra

This should allow you to run "psql liminfra" as the given $USERNAME and get to
the empty liminfra database. To tell the code distribution how to access the
database, copy the limesco.conf.sample file to /etc/limesco.conf and modify it
if needed. Then, run the upgrade tool:

	$ upgrade.pl

This will initialize your database so you can get started. Read the DEVELOPMENT
file for more information on developing liminfra.
